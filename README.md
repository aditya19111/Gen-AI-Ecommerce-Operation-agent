# Gen-AI-Ecommerce-Operation-agent
GenAI-powered e-commerce operations agent for managing inventory, orders, and demand forecasting. Supports natural language queries, AI-driven insights, and knowledge retrieval. Cloud-ready with free/enterprise stack options. Built for SMEs to cut stockouts and boost forecasting accuracy.

Plan – GenAI Smart E-commerce Operations Agent

1. Project Goals
   
• Build a GenAI-powered agent for inventory & order operations.
• Allow natural language queries (chat interface).
• Provide AI-driven forecasting, alerts, and insights.
• Deploy on cloud (free or enterprise-ready).

2. Key Resources

Tech Stack:
• Frontend: Streamlit (free) → React (enterprise).
• Backend: FastAPI / Flask.
• Database: Supabase (free) → PostgreSQL on AWS RDS.
• AI Models: Hugging Face (free) + Prophet (forecasting).
• LLM: Open-source (BERT/T5) → Gemini/OpenAI GPT for production.
• Cloud: Render/Railway (free) → AWS/GCP for scaling.

3. Project Timeline (12 Weeks Plan)

Phase 1 – Setup & Planning (Week 1–2)
• Define business KPIs (stockouts, delays, cancellations).
• Collect sample datasets (orders, inventory, delivery logs).
• Choose deployment path (free vs enterprise stack).

Phase 2 – Data Pipeline (Week 3–4)
• Build ETL to ingest order + inventory + delivery data.
• Data cleaning: SKU unification, duplicate removal.
• Store in PostgreSQL/Supabase.

Phase 3 – AI Models (Week 5–6)
• Train baseline forecasting model (Prophet/LightGBM).
• Build classification models (refund requests, delay patterns).
• Set up embeddings (Hugging Face / Gemini embeddings).

Phase 4 – LLM Agent (Week 7–8)
• Build natural language → structured query converter.
• Integrate function calling (e.g., check_inventory()).
• Add escalation logic (low confidence → human review).

Phase 5 – Frontend & Backend (Week 9–10)
• Chatbot interface (Streamlit/React).
• Dashboard for managers (inventory risk, demand forecast).
• Backend orchestration via FastAPI.

Phase 6 – Cloud Deployment & MLOps (Week 11)
• Deploy on Render/Hugging Face Spaces (free tier).
• Add logging (MLflow or CSV logs).
• Implement fallback & retry mechanisms.

Phase 7 – Testing & Launch (Week 12)
• Test with sample order data.
• Measure accuracy & response quality.
• Launch MVP for pilot users.

6. Success Metrics
• Forecast Accuracy: >80% accuracy for demand prediction.
• Query Handling: 90% of queries answered without human escalation.
• Response Time: <3 seconds per query (with free stack, <5s).
• Business Impact: Reduce stockouts & overstocking by at least 20%.
